# Redirecting booking confirmation data

OnceHub allows you to send booking confirmation data to the redirect page via URL parameters. Every time a booking is successfully scheduled, the booking form submission data and information about the booking that was scheduled will be converted into key-value pairs (KVPs) and appended to the redirect URL.

This feature can be used to create a custom confirmation page, enable client-side integrations, or enrich customer data profiles, among other applications.

## Booking confirmation data sent via URL parameters

Two types of booking confirmation data will be sent to your redirect page via URL parameters:

1. **Booking form submission data** - Customer information submitted to the booking form
2. **Booking data created when scheduling** - System-generated data about the booking

### Booking form submission data

Customer information submitted to the booking form will be added as URL parameters and sent to the custom confirmation page URL upon redirect. Any booking form field (including custom fields) for which the customer has submitted data will be added to the redirect URL. Empty booking form fields will not be added to the redirect URL.

## Constraints

The following constraints are important to keep in mind when redirecting booking confirmation data:

- Booking confirmation data will only be sent to the redirect page when a booking is scheduled (not canceled, rescheduled, or reassigned).
- OnceHub does not impose length limits for fields passed in the redirect URL. If the length of the query string exceeds the URL character limit, the URL will be truncated and some data may not be sent.

<Tabs groupId="oncehub-product" queryString className="product-tabs">
  <TabItem value="booking-pages" label="Booking Pages" default>

Booking confirmation data will not be sent to the redirect page if you are using a CRM record ID to <a target="_blank" href="https://help.oncehub.com/help/prepopulated-booking-forms">skip or prepopulate the booking form</a>, because this data is encrypted.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="booking-calendars" label="Booking Calendars">

All datetime values are sent in ISO 8601 format in UTC.
