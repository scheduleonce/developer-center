## Options for the client-side libraries

The client-side libraries provide two different methods of extracting booking confirmation data from OnceHub at the time of scheduling:

* [Redirecting booking confirmation data](https://developers.oncehub.com/docs/redirecting-booking-confirmation-data), via URL parameters (when using <a target="_blank" href="https://help.oncehub.com/help/automatic-redirect">Automatic redirect</a>), and
* [Collecting data from an embedded Booking page](https://developers.oncehub.com/docs/collecting-data-from-an-embedded-booking-page), via JavaScript (when using <a target="_blank" href="https://help.oncehub.com/help/website-embed">Website embed</a>)

## Apply our client-side libraries to your business processes

Depending on your business and development needs, our client-side libraries can be used in a variety of ways, including:

* Displaying a custom confirmation message
* Integrating with other client-side applications
* Enriching customer profile data

Continue reading to learn more about these use cases.

## Display a custom confirmation message

By default, after a customer has successfully scheduled a booking through your booking page, they will see a confirmation page that displays information about their booking.

If you want to display a custom confirmation message using booking confirmation data to your customers, you can do so in several different ways:

* Automatically redirect customers to your own custom confirmation page
* Display a custom confirmation message inside the embedding frame
* Display a custom confirmation message in a popup over the embedding parent page

Your custom confirmation message can include details about the booking that was just scheduled, as well as customer information submitted via the booking form.

## Integrate with client-side applications

OnceHub can send booking confirmation data to external client-side applications, allowing you to create powerful integrations with third-party out-of-the-box tools or your own custom development. 

Some of the most common client-side integrations you may wish to incorporate into your business processes are:

* Pre-populating a web form
* Pre-populating a survey
* Sending a custom confirmation email to your customers after scheduling

OnceHub client-side integrations allow you to provide a seamless experience to your customers.

## Enrich customer profile data

A robust and integrated customer profile is essential to effective marketing analytics. By enriching your customer data repository with high-value personal information provided at the time of booking, you can present more relevant, timely, and personalized marketing to your leads and customers.

Online scheduling presents a key opportunity to gather identifying information at the peak of the prospect’s interest. When a customer schedules a booking, they are more forthcoming with personal data, and are more likely to submit complete and accurate information than other modes of data collection.

By applying our client-side libraries to your booking pages, you can capture meaningful information at a crucial point in the customer journey, when prospects are ready to engage.
