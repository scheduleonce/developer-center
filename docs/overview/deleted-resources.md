# Deleted resources

Deleted resources are usually still accessible after deletion in _redacted_ mode:

1. The deleted resource will not be returned in any list request.
2. If the resource is requested specifically, it will be returned but will only contain the `id`, `object`, and an additional `deleted` field with the value of `true`.

For example, a call to

```
GET /booking-pages/BP-X0LCRU5LES
```

Will return the object in redacted mode:

```json
{
  "id": "BP-X0LCRU5LES",
  "object": "booking_page",
  "deleted": true
}
```

However, `BP-X0LCRU5LES` booking page will not be returned when listing all booking pages via

```
GET /booking-pages
```

## Deleted resources in expansions

The same is true for expanded responses. When expanded, deleted objects will return in _redacted_ mode as well.

:::info

This behavior ensures that your application can gracefully handle references to deleted resources without breaking, while still providing feedback that the resource has been deleted.
