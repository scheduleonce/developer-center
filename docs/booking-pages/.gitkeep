# Booking Pages Product Documentation (Legacy)

This folder will contain documentation specific to the Booking Pages product.

Currently, all documentation is shared between products and located in the `shared/` directory.
Add product-specific guides, tutorials, or API usage examples here as needed.

**Note:** Booking Pages is a legacy product. We recommend using Booking Calendars for new implementations.
