A big part of driving business is getting new leads. Or in our terms - getting meetings!
This is ofcourse a trailing metric, but to stay on top of your performance you want to get the data into your BI tool as soon as possible and with as little effort as possible.
The OnceHub API makes this a breeze! Using the created_after and created_before parameters you can automate the export of all bookings created in a specific date range - showing you the performance of your lead sourcing channels in the last day, week or month.
Combine this functionality with the ability to filter based on the booking owner, booking page, event type, or master page and you have a tool that shows you exactly what is working and where to improve.
You can find more information about the GET Bookings endpoint and its parameters in the [API reference.]()
