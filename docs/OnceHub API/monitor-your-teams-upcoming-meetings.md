As a leading indicator to improve your team’s overall performance and to spread the load while optimizing capacity, you want to know who has how many meetings coming up in the next day, week, or month.
Using the OnceHub API you can automatically create reports or update your BI tools and dashboards. Use the start_after and start_before filter parameters when retrieving bookings to dynamically change the dates that you want to look at and further improve insights by narrowing the view to specific booking owners, booking pages, event types, or master pages.
If utilizing your team efficiently is important to you, then these insights will help you to prioritize those team members that have a lower meeting count and take action proactively!
You can find more information about the GET Bookings endpoint and its parameters in the [API reference.]()
