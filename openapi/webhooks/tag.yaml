name: Webhook Events
description: |
  Event payloads sent to your webhook endpoints when booking and conversation lifecycle events occur.

  These schemas define the structure of the HTTP POST requests that OnceHub sends to your configured webhook URLs. Each event includes metadata about when it occurred and a data object containing the relevant booking or conversation information.

  To start receiving webhook events, [create a webhook subscription](/reference/booking-calendars/#tag/webhooks/post/webhooks) with your desired event triggers.
