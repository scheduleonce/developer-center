      Book a time from the available time slots

      > [!note]
      > Notes On Using This Endpoint
      > * This endpoint is designed to be used with the "Get available time slots" endpoint. First, retrieve available time slots for a specific time range, and then use this endpoint to book one of those slots.
      > * You can only select a location from those offered within the available time slots.
      > * This endpoint doesn't support booking calendars with required custom fields.
      > * All datetime strings are [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) in full form. For example, `2024-11-29T09:30:00.000Z`.

      > [!tip]
      > Using Custom Fields  
      > In addition to the standard fields, you can pass your own data by including custom key-value pairs within the `booking_form` object in the request body.
      >
      > * **Field Name (Key)**: The key for each custom field must exactly match the mapped field name of the corresponding question configured in your Booking page's form settings.
      > * **Field Value**: The data type of the value must match the question's type:
      >   * For Text and Picklist (single-select) questions, provide a string.
      >   * For Picklist (multi-select) questions, provide an array of strings.
      >
      > Please note that for picklist fields, any values that do not match a pre-configured option will be ignored by the system during booking.
